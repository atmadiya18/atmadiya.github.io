abstract: To study the population convergence of N-player game using learned strategies, we developed static N-player Hawk-Dove game with interaction dependent pay-offs at each stage. We studied convergence of the population w.r.t to MSNE using different strategy models & interactions. We also injected inherent cooperation through a code-of-conduct giving higher population pay-off than MSNE. Future work involves quantifying rewards of cooperation & using Informed Reinforcement learners

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
